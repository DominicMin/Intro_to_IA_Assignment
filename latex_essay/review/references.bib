  abstract="This work presents some initial results of our research about the design and implementation of ``LiSA'' (Link Student Assistant), a chatbot intended to help students in their campus life, through information and services. The focus of our research is to understand which kind of information and services are better accessed through this kind of touch point, how the chatbot personality influences the user experience and the interaction and which level of intelligence should be implemented. After an analysis of the state of the art in the considered application domain we investigated, through a survey, the users' needs and their inclination to the use of a chatbot for this specific purpose. A chatbot was created to deliver the survey, allowing to understand both the users' needs and their behaviour while using the tool.",

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis from text consists of extracting information about opinions, sentiments, and even emotions conveyed by writers towards topics of interest. It is often equated to opinion mining, but it should also encompass emotion mining. Opinion mining involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning to determine the attitude of a writer towards a subject. Emotion mining is also using similar technologies but is concerned with detecting and classifying writers emotions toward events or topics. Textual emotion-mining methods have various applications, including gaining information about customer satisfaction, helping in selecting teaching materials in e-learning, recommending products based on users emotions, and even predicting mental-health disorders. In surveys on sentiment analysis, which are often old or incomplete, the strong link between opinion mining and emotion mining is understated. This motivates the need for a different and new perspective on the literature on sentiment analysis, with a focus on emotion mining. We present the state-of-the-art methods and propose the following contributions: (1) a taxonomy of sentiment analysis; (2) a survey on polarity classification methods and resources, especially those related to emotion mining; (3) a complete survey on emotion theories and emotion-mining research; and (4) some useful resources, including lexicons and datasets.},

  abstract = {In Japan, the number of college students suffering from changes in the communicative environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing. However, many college students do not use on-campus counseling services even though they are available. The reason for this is students’ psychological barriers to counseling. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to reduce the psychological barrier and recommend counseling services to college students. We defined dialogue tasks for maintaining mental health, i.e., lifelogging, confiding, and recommending counseling services. We also defined the required and optional slots for each dialogue task. We used crowdsourcing to collect an example dataset of ideal dialogues between chatbots and users. From the collected data, we categorized the chatbot's responses and design a task- and slot-based response-selection method that is based on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis.},
