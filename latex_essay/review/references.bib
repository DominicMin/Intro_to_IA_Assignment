  abstract="This work presents some initial results of our research about the design and implementation of ``LiSA'' (Link Student Assistant), a chatbot intended to help students in their campus life, through information and services. The focus of our research is to understand which kind of information and services are better accessed through this kind of touch point, how the chatbot personality influences the user experience and the interaction and which level of intelligence should be implemented. After an analysis of the state of the art in the considered application domain we investigated, through a survey, the users' needs and their inclination to the use of a chatbot for this specific purpose. A chatbot was created to deliver the survey, allowing to understand both the users' needs and their behaviour while using the tool.",

  abstract = {In Japan, the number of college students suffering from changes in the communicative environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing. However, many college students do not use on-campus counseling services even though they are available. The reason for this is students’ psychological barriers to counseling. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to reduce the psychological barrier and recommend counseling services to college students. We defined dialogue tasks for maintaining mental health, i.e., lifelogging, confiding, and recommending counseling services. We also defined the required and optional slots for each dialogue task. We used crowdsourcing to collect an example dataset of ideal dialogues between chatbots and users. From the collected data, we categorized the chatbot's responses and design a task- and slot-based response-selection method that is based on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) driven chatbots provide instant feedback to support learning. Yet, the impacts of different feedback types on behavior and brain activation remain underexplored. We investigated how metacognitive, affective, and neutral feedback from an educational chatbot affected learning outcomes and brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Students receiving metacognitive feedback showed higher transfer scores, greater metacognitive sensitivity, and increased brain activation in the frontopolar area and middle temporal gyrus compared to other feedback types. Such activation correlated with metacognitive sensitivity. Students receiving affective feedback showed better retention scores than those receiving neutral feedback, along with higher activation in the supramarginal gyrus. Students receiving neutral feedback exhibited higher activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than other feedback types. The machine learning model identified key brain regions that predicted transfer scores. These findings underscore the potential of diverse feedback types in enhancing learning via human-chatbot interaction, and provide neurophysiological signatures.},
